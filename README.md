Estimating energy consumption of an autoclave using thermodynamics based semi-empirical models

The use of Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymers in aircraft structures has continuously increased over
the years. This is due to their excellent specific strength and stiffness. However mainstream CFRP
manufacturing processes are energy intensive resulting in high cost of production and environmental
impacts. Autoclave curing is one of the most energy consuming processes in CFRP manufacturing
due to the mode of heat transfer and heat loss. In order to improve the energy efficiency of autoclave
curing, one needs to understand energy usage in an autoclave and factors that influence it. This work
present two thermodynamic based models used to estimate energy consumption in an autoclave. These
models are scalable and parameterised which allow the impact of process parameters including cure
cycle and scale of production on energy consumption to be investigated. The first model presented in
this study is an analytical model that estimates the energy consumption using Fourier heat equations
with adequate boundary conditions. This method assumes a constant temperature throughout the
autoclave, a temperature equivalent to the predetermined cure temperature cycle. In order to account
for temperature variation at the walls of the autoclave and temperature gradients of the gases within
the autoclave, an alternative model was developed. In this model, the Multi-Relaxation-Time Lattice
Boltzmann method‚Äù (MRT LBM), introduced by Yang et al., was used to simulate the transient
autoclave gas velocity and temperature flow. By combining this with the Fourier Heat Equation,
the energy consumption of an autoclave was modelled more accurately. The output from the two
models were compared to energy consumption data collected from a labscale autoclave. The estimated
energy consumption from the analytical method was 20.6KWh, 16.71% more than the measured value
of 17.65KWh. The MRT LBM method predicted 18.84kWh, about 6.51% higher than the recorded
value, indicating a better match. The two models where used to discriminate the energy consumption
during cure. The energy required to heat up the entire autoclave body contributed over 69% of
the energy consumption. This was followed by energy needed to compensate for heat loss which
contributed to 28% of total energy consumption. The total energy required to heat up the composite 
mould assembly and nitrogen gas accounted for less than 3% of the total energy consumption. This
showed the low energy efficiency of the autoclave process. This study also investigates the influence
of design and process parameters on autoclave energy consumption. This was achieved by varying
selected parameters and calculating the resulting energy consumption. By doing this, parameters
that significantly influence the energy consumption of autoclave curing were identified. The total
consumed energy was found to vary linearly with the loading capacity of the autoclave, as well as
its structural size. Varying the cure cycle also led to significant variation in energy consumption.
